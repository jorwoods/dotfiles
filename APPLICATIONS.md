# Applications

This is a summary of useful applications I install, and where more information
about them can be found.

[fd-find](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), A nicer version of the linux `find`
command.

[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), a commandline fuzzy finder. Useful for
quickly finding and selecting files from the commandline or within neovim.

[keychain](https://www.funtoo.org/Funtoo:Keychain) allows reuse of the ssh-agent
once per system and user instead of once per login. Drastically simplifies
managing ssh keys.

zsh, a nicer shell for working more comfortably from the command line.
